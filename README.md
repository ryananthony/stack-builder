Texas Hold'em Stack Builder
===========================

This will be a Chip Stack Calculator for Poker House Games. 

# User defines his/her poker chip collection based on color and quantity.
# User selects a Big Blind value, stack type and number of players.

System will then calculate a good distribution of chips for each player based on the SHORT/STANDARD/DEEP stack size chosen. Once calculated, jQuery should update the div corresponding to each chip denomination reflecting a visual represenation of the returned number of chips.
